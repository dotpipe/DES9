# DES9 v1.0

DES9 is a bitwise-operating program. The reality is that it probably doesn't do much, here. The reality is instead, also, the real ability to shrink data to confounding-ly small levels, by operating with a key set, the 5+bits that we see in this program generating so much more data from it. By descending in this form, with an absolute faculty number, ( e.g. the number of bytes to attempt as a maximum, argument 1) the program iterates to that end. Bitwise enumeration is in itself a somewhat metaphorical way of developing a conscious thought. There are 2^4 possible outcomes with this program. But in reality, there are unlimitied more. The 2^4 is actually per faculty. This engineering represents the totality of the cryptographic and compressions programs field. Thereby, in this instance of the program, there are no limits. And to be perfectly fair, there's no number it cannot do. There is no threshing floor it cannot derive. So by creating this program, it stands to reason, we may wish to find a way to reverse engineer this program and collocate a perfectly huge number of bytes into 5 bits. Good luck.
